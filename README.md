# Chatr - A Parse Chatroom

This is a lab I completed for Facebook iOS University/Scope USC. The backend was built on Parse.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 * [x] User can sign up or log in and receive a warning if a username already exists or if their login is incorrect.
 * [x] User can view a list of messages in the chatroom in ascending chronological order.
 * [x] Each message contains the username of the sender.
 
Notes:

The hardest part of this lab was figuring out how to use Parse. It all clicked in the end!
